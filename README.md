This program simulates an air traffic control tower allocating runway space within a 24 hour period. The simulated air traffic control tower has the ability to authorize and queue flight arrivals and departures. 
If the queue is full, the air traffic control tower will begin to deny departures and hold arrivals in the air.
The user has the ability to set the departure frequency and arrival frequency.
